    The pip interface


        ](./)


# [The pip interface](#the-pip-interface)


uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands. These
commands work directly with the virtual environment, in contrast to uv's primary interfaces where
the virtual environment is managed automatically. The `uv pip` interface exposes the speed and
functionality of uv to power users and projects that are not ready to transition away from `pip` and
`pip-tools`.


The following sections discuss the basics of using `uv pip`:


* [Creating and using environments](environments/)

* [Installing and managing packages](packages/)

* [Inspecting environments and packages](inspection/)

* [Declaring package dependencies](dependencies/)

* [Locking and syncing environments](compile/)


Please note these commands do not *exactly* implement the interfaces and behavior of the tools they
are based on. The further you stray from common workflows, the more likely you are to encounter
differences. Consult the [pip-compatibility guide](compatibility/) for details.


Important


uv does not rely on or invoke pip. The pip interface is named as such to highlight its dedicated
purpose of providing low-level commands that match pip's interface and to separate it from the
rest of uv's commands which operate at a higher level of abstraction.
